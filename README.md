##DATA ANALYTICS AND VISULIZATION ASSIGNMENT##

Aim
The aim of this study is to select, apply and study network data analysis across different graph scales using passenger flight data.

Problem Definition
Many large data sets have a network dimensionality (social networks, peer-to-peer file transfer, bit coin, organisation, supply chain, connected systems…etc.).  Practical applications of network analysis include understanding its resilience to disturbances, robustness to attacks, and efficiency of processes on networks (information, energy transfer). The techniques draw knowledge from applied statistics, applied physics, graph theory, and data science. More recent advances have developed graph neural networks to discover graph features to quantify challenging behaviour. 
In this case you’re to apply classic feature-based graph analysis to flight data to demonstrate  multi-scale  graph  analysis  covered  in  the  lectures.  The  aim  is  to represent important notions in a low data dimension to enable effective communication and dissemination. 
The objectives of this works are as follows:
1.   Transform 1 chosen month of flight data into a network form and visualise it using any software or coding package.
2. Implement graph analysis across 3 different graph scales: 1) macro-scale (statistical  analysis),  2)  meso-scale (community  analysis),  3)  node-level (centrality analysis).
3.   Assess and discuss the 3 different graph analysis scales and what they mean for air transport networks in real socioeconomic and engineering terms.

Data
The dataset is given on Canvas - contains domestic flight data for 1 month across different countries in the world and different years. An example of the image from the database is shown below. Some degree of data cleaning maybe required to mimic real world data problems, e.g., the location of some airports maybe missing or incorrect.
